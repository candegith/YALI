# YALI

These two notebooks can be used to read an amino acid sequence from a FASTA file and codon optimise it using a codon preference table for Y. lipolytica. Additionally, the Sequence optimisation notebook can calculate the GC content of the sequence and keep it within an acceptable range (20-80%), as well as be used to iterate through the sequence to avoid specific forbidden sequences (i.e., certain restriction sites, long polynucleotide stretches).  

Enjoy!
